-- Quest: Sky-high (Limsa Lominsa)
--
-- Checked against the client's quest script (kawari-questdump, 2026-10-21) and Bob's Chronofoil capture of the Limsa
-- story on retail (2026-10-21):
-- Sequence 0:   ACTOR0 offers it (scene 0, a yield: 1 accepts), then the client's empty scene 1: accepted straight into
--               sequence 255.
-- Sequence 255: ACTOR1: the reward (scene 2, a yield with the reward picked). Retail then sends FinishQuest for 398
--               too, with no rewards of its own (`mark_quest_completed`, as 543 does for 464).

-- Retail sent FinishQuest for this one too, straight after this quest's (Bob's Chronofoil capture of 2026-10-21).
