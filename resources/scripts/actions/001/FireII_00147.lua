-- Fire II (Lv. 18): the target and enemies near it.
-- NOTE: Astral Fire and Umbral Ice (the job gauge) aren't implemented: no potency or MP changes from them. Since 7.x Thunder spells need Thunderhead; without the gauge, changing element (this) grants it.
-- Also used by the masked mage in a quest battle (recorded_amounts there).
-- NPCs use this ID too (quest battles): they keep NPC_POTENCY and nothing else, see isPlayerCaster.
-- Potencies: 7.x tooltip (max level); check the in-game tooltip at your level.
